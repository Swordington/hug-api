# hug-api
A very basic express.js API that returns the URL to a hug gif and some other information.

## Use me:
Just send a GET request to hugs.sword.wtf. There are no required headers for this request. **HEADS UP! The hosted version of this API is currently offline.**<br/>
**Ratelimiting:** All requests to the production hug API are ratelimited to 100 requests per 5 minutes.
